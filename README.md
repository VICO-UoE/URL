## Features at a glance
- We train a single universal (task-agnostic) network on 8 visual (training) datasets on Meta-dataset: ImageNet, Omniglot, Aircraft, Birds, Textures, Quick Draw, Fungi, VGG Flower, with state-of-the-art performances on all (13) testing datasets for few-shot learning.

- During meta-testing, the universal representations can be efficiently adapted by our proposed pre-classifier alignment (a linear transformation) learned on the support set to transform the representations to a more discriminative space.

- We propose to attach a set of light weight task-specific adapters to the universal network (the universal network can be learned from multiple datasets or one single diverse dataset, e.g. ImageNet) and learn task-specific adapters on the support set from scratch for adapting the few-shot model to the tasks from unseen domains.

- We systematically study various combinations of several design choices for task-specific adaptation, which have not been explored before, including adapter connection types (serial or residual), parameterizations (matrix and its decomposed variations, channelwise operations) and estimation of task-specific parameters.

- Attaching parameteric adapters in matrix form to convolutional layers with residual connections significantly boosts the state-of-the-art performance in most domains, especially resulting in superior performance in unseen domains on Meta-Dataset

- In this repo, we provide code of the URL, the best task adaptation strategy in TSA, and other baselines like SDL, vanilla MDL and other evaluation settings.

## Dependencies
This code requires the following:
* Python 3.6 or greater
* PyTorch 1.0 or greater
* TensorFlow 1.14 or greater

## Installation
* Clone or download this repository.
* Configure Meta-Dataset:
    * Follow the "User instructions" in the [Meta-Dataset repository](https://github.com/google-research/meta-dataset) for "Installation" and "Downloading and converting datasets".
    * Edit ```./meta-dataset/data/reader.py``` in the meta-dataset repository to change ```dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size, drop_remainder=False)``` to ```dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size, drop_remainder=True)```. (The code can run with ```drop_remainder=False```, but in our work, we drop the remainder such that we will not use very small batch for some domains and we recommend to drop the remainder for reproducing our methods.)
    * To test unseen domain (out-of-domain) performance on additional datasets, i.e. MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, follow the installation instruction in the [CNAPs repository](https://github.com/cambridge-mlg/cnaps) to get these datasets.

## Initialization
1. Before doing anything, first run the following commands.
    ```
    ulimit -n 50000
    export META_DATASET_ROOT=<root directory of the cloned or downloaded Meta-Dataset repository>
    export RECORDS=<the directory where tf-records of MetaDataset are stored>
    ```
    
    Note the above commands need to be run every time you open a new command shell.

2. Enter the root directory of this project, i.e. the directory where this project was cloned or downloaded.

### Train the Universal Representation Learning Network
1. The easiest way is to download our [pre-trained URL model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dv8TX6iQ-BE2NMpfd0sQmH2q4mShmo1A/view?usp=sharing) and evaluate its feature using our Pre-classifier Alignment (PA). To download the pretrained URL model, one can use `gdown` (installed by ```pip install gdown```) and execute the following command in the root directory of this project:
    ```
    gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Dv8TX6iQ-BE2NMpfd0sQmH2q4mShmo1A && md5sum url.zip && unzip url.zip -d ./saved_results/ && rm url.zip
    
    ```
    This will donwnload the URL model and place it in the ```./saved_results``` directory. One can evaluate this model by our PA (see the [Meta-Testing step](#meta-testing-with-pre-classifier-alignment-pa))

2. Alternatively, one can train the model from scratch: 1) train 8 single domain learning networks; 2) train the universal feature extractor as follow. 

#### Train Single Domain Learning Networks
1. The easiest way is to download our [pre-trained models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MvUcvQ8OQtoOk1MIiJmK6_G8p4h8cbY9/view?usp=sharing) and use them to obtain a universal set of features directly. To download single domain learning networks, execute the following command in the root directory of this project:
    ```
    gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MvUcvQ8OQtoOk1MIiJmK6_G8p4h8cbY9 && md5sum sdl.zip && unzip sdl.zip -d ./saved_results/ && rm sdl.zip
    ```

    This will download all single domain learning models and place them in the ```./saved_results``` directory of this project.


2. Alternatively, instead of using the pretrained models, one can train the models from scratch.
   To train 8 single domain learning networks, run:
    ```
    ./scripts/train_resnet18_sdl.sh
    ```


#### Train the Universal Feature Extractor
To learn the universal feature extractor by distilling the knowledge from pre-trained single domain learning networks, run: 
```
./scripts/train_resnet18_url.sh
```

### Meta-Testing with Pre-classifier Alignment (PA)

</p>
<p align="center">
    Figure 2. <b>PA - Pre-classifier Alignment</b> for Adapting Features in Meta-test.
</p>

This step would run our Pre-classifier Alignment (PA) procedure per task to adapt the features to a discriminate space and build a Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC) on the support set to classify query samples, run:

```
./scripts/test_resnet18_pa.sh
```

## Cross-domain Few-shot Learning with Task-specific Adapters
<p align="center">
  <img src="./figures/tsa.png" style="width:100%">
</p>
<p align="center">
    Figure 3. Cross-domain Few-shot Learning with <b>Task-specific Adapters (TSA)</b>.
</p>

We provide code for attaching task-specific adapters (TSA) to a single universal network learned from meta-train and learn the task-specific adapters on the support set. One can download our [pre-trained URL model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dv8TX6iQ-BE2NMpfd0sQmH2q4mShmo1A/view?usp=sharing) (see [here](#train-the-universal-representation-learning-network) to download the URL or SDL models or train them from scratch) and evaluate its feature adapted by residual adapters in matrix form and pre-classifier alignment, run:
```
./scripts/test_resnet18_tsa.sh
```

One may want to train the model from scratch from the Meta-training step. For single-domain learning network, see [here](#train-single-domain-learning-networks) to learn a single network from ImageNet with ResNet-18. For multi-domain learning setting, one can learn a URL model (see [here](#train-the-universal-representation-learning-network)) or learn a vanilla MDL model (see [here](#train-a-vanilla-multi-domain-learning-network)). Note that, one may need to amend the input of `--model.name` and `--model.dir` in `./scripts/test_resnet18_tsa.sh` to the model learned from meta-training and amend `--test.mode` to `sdl` if the backbone is learned from ImageNet only in meta-training and then run the TSA.

## Expected Results
Below are the results extracted from our papers. The results will vary from run to run by a percent or two up or down due to the fact that the Meta-Dataset reader generates different tasks each run, randomnes in training the networks and in TSA and PA optimization. Note, the results are updated with the up-to-date evaluation from Meta-Dataset. Make sure that you use the up-to-date code from the Meta-Dataset repository to convert the dataset and set ```shuffle_buffer_size=1000``` as mentioned in https://github.com/google-research/meta-dataset/issues/54.

## Other Usage

### Train a Vanilla Multi-domain Learning Network
To train a vanilla multi-domain learning network (MDL) on Meta-Dataset, run:

```
./scripts/train_resnet18_mdl.sh
```

#### Other Classifiers for Meta-Testing (optional)
One can use other classifiers for meta-testing, e.g. use ```--test.loss-opt``` to select nearest centroid classifier (ncc, default), support vector machine (svm), logistic regression (lr), Mahalanobis distance from Simple CNAPS (scm), or k-nearest neighbor (knn); use ```--test.feature-norm``` to normalize feature (l2) or not for svm and lr; use ```--test.distance``` to specify the feature similarity function (l2 or cos) for NCC. 

To evaluate the feature extractor with NCC and cosine similarity, run:

```
python test_extractor.py --test.loss-opt ncc --test.feature-norm none --test.distance cos --model.name=url --model.dir <directory of url> 
```

### Five-shot and Five-way-one-shot Meta-test (optional)
One can evaluate the feature extractor in meta-testing for five-shot or five-way-one-shot setting by setting ```--test.type``` as '5shot' or '1shot', respectively.

To test the feature extractor for varying-way-five-shot on the test splits of all datasets, run:

```
python test_extractor.py --test.type 5shot --test.loss-opt ncc --test.feature-norm none --test.distance cos --model.name=url --model.dir <directory of url>
```

If one wants to evaluate our proposed URL and TSA method in 5-shot or 5-way-1-shot settings, please use ```test_extractor_pa.py``` and ```test_extractor_tsa.py``` with setting ```--test.type``` as '5shot' or '1shot'.
